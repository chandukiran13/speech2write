The Repo is for the REST API example of speach to write conversion of English.
I implemented the REST API in form of discord bot (as Discord uses REST API).
To check the code you should invite the bot to a server on discord, but I couldn't find a hosting service for the bot.
You can use the code for your own bot as you can just replace the TOKEN.
[here](https://discord.com/api/oauth2/authorize?client_id=843391165453303808&permissions=2148005952&scope=bot) is the link for the bot.
